                        <p>This course teaches you React in-depth, from the ground up, step by step by diving into all the core basics, exploring tons of examples and also introducing you to advanced concepts as well.</p>
                        <p>You'll get all the theory, tons of examples and demos, assignments and exercises and tons of important knowledge that is skipped by most other resources - after all, there is a reason why this course is that huge! :)</p>
                        <p>And in case you don't even know why you would want to learn React and you're just here because of some ad or "the algorithm" - no worries: ReactJS is a key technology as a web developer and in this course I will also explain WHY it's that important!</p>`,
